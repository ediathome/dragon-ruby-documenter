# dragon-ruby-documenter UNSUPPORTED
This small app dumps a basic DragonRuby documentation to a Markdown file.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED AS THE DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY THE DRAGONRUBY TEAM IS NOW MUCH BETTER. SO PLEASE USE THE OFFICIAL DRAGONRUBY DOCUMENTATION INSTEAD.**

You can find example outputs here:

* [PDF file](https://github.com/ediathome/dragon-ruby-documenter/raw/master/output_pdf/DragonRubyObjectMethods.pdf)
* [HTML version](https://ediathome.github.io/dragon-ruby-documenter/)

## Howto
You will need DragonRuby installed and in your path. Run the following command in the project dir (tested on macOS):

```shell
dragonruby .
```

Then in the running game click on the 'Write documentation' button.
